# leravel
Worst php framework

## What is leravel?
a very shitty php framework

## Features
- ðŸ§» A very cool router
- ðŸ“œ A very cool template system(blade wannabe template system ðŸ’€)
- ðŸ”¨ A built in admin panel
- ðŸ’¬ A built in localization system
- ðŸ¥‹ Lightweight i think

## Getting Started
1. Download a php server software (I recommend laragon)
2. Create a new website
3. Download the latest source code from releases
4. Unzip source code in website directory
5. Modify app/settings.json
6. Don't forget to change Database.Database Name from settings.json or it won't work
7. Make a website

## Leravel Admin

<br>
To get to the leravel admin you need to go to /?admin<br>
Admin username and password are in /leravel/admin/account.ini<br>
If you want to disable admin panel you can disable it from settings.json

## How can I stay up to date?
when you enter leravel admin it will check for updates and if it founds an update it will remind you to update
